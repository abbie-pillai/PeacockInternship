Key Features:
- Real-time metrics monitoring across cross-device experiments
- Statistical inference analysis with a 30-day rolling window
- 5 automated metric calculations for experiment tracking
- 5 customizable filters for detailed data exploration
- Daily automated data refresh pipeline

2. Automated Inference Engine
An automated system for processing and analyzing A/B test results using advanced statistical frameworks.
Key Features:
- Automated statistical inference across multiple test scenarios
- Machine learning models for pattern detection
- Real-time data processing pipeline
- Comprehensive test result analysis
